Scheme of directory tree is in lsmd/lsmd/SVC_SCHEME

1. Reading configuration from /run/svc/services/*/
	eg.:
	/run/svc/services/network/httpd/httpd.svc

2. Registering process on filesystem
	eg.:
	/run/svc/current/online/network/httpd/

3. Integrate lsmd with SysV Init - starting services
   with runlevels

4. Make template of service and instances
   choose between style like systemd or bash script parsing?

5. Monitoring service and watching status. Define action
   eg. "if service is down - auto restart after 5 sec"

6. Make service CLI console for configure and managing
   services
